# HTTP Methods and Status Codes: A Detailed Guide

## Introduction

In modern web applications, **HTTP Methods** and **Status Codes** are fundamental concepts for communicating between clients (e.g., browsers or mobile apps) and servers. They form the basis of RESTful APIs, where each HTTP method performs a specific action, and status codes inform the client about the result of these actions.

In this article, we'll explore the various **HTTP Methods** and **Status Codes** in-depth and understand their use in **Spring** applications, without diving into code but focusing on their roles in web communication.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods define the type of operation you want to perform on a resource. They help structure the request in a meaningful way. Hereâ€™s an exhaustive list of methods you might encounter and their purposes:

### 1. **GET**
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve information (read-only).
   - **Use Case**: Fetch a list of products, get details of a single user.
   - **Idempotent**: Yes.
   - **Safe**: Yes (does not modify the resource).

   **Spring Context**: GET is the most commonly used method, especially for APIs returning resources to be viewed or consumed.

### 2. **POST**
   - **Purpose**: Submit data to the server to create a new resource.
   - **Use Case**: Creating a new blog post, registering a new user.
   - **Idempotent**: No.
   - **Safe**: No (modifies server state).

   **Spring Context**: Often used in form submissions or when creating new resources.
