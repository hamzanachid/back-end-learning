## How HTTP Methods and Status Codes Interact in Spring

In a **Spring** application, HTTP methods map directly to controller methods, and the response status codes are usually handled automatically based on the outcome of the request.

- **GET** requests typically return `200 OK` with data or `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist.
- **POST** requests may return `201 Created` when a new resource is successfully created or `400 Bad Request` if there’s an issue with the input.
- **PUT** requests often result in `200 OK` or `204 No Content` for successful updates, and `404 Not Found` if the resource to update doesn’t exist.
- **DELETE** requests can return `204 No Content` when successfully deleting a resource or `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn’t exist.

Spring’s exception handling mechanism allows developers to customize the status codes returned in response to various application states, providing clarity and control over API interactions.

## Conclusion

Understanding HTTP methods and status codes is key to building efficient and user-friendly REST APIs. Each HTTP method serves a specific purpose, and each status code gives the client feedback on what happened with their request.

In **Spring applications**, these methods and status codes work together seamlessly, allowing for clear, predictable communication between clients and servers. Knowing how and when to use them leads to well-structured, intuitive APIs that provide meaningful information to both developers and users.
